                    Hello! My name is Zhane and I am very new to coding so, please be patient with me. I am originally from Brookly, NY and moved to PA at the age of 12.
                    I love to draw, paint, make clothes as a hobby so, if you know someone that likes handmade art let me know. My family is originally from Barbados and Jamaica and yes Barbados like where Rihanna is from. 
                    This is my first webpage and it may not be the best but it is progress. I cannot wait to see my progress 3 months from now and hopefully i will be a little lessed stressed.
                </p>
